# graph-api-labview
A Graph implementation in LabVIEW

![LabVIEW Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/LabVIEW-2020%20SP1-%23E37725.svg?})

## Goals
To utilize maps and sets to implement a reusable graph library with a nice interface and commonly-used graph algorithms (traversal/search/sorting/etc).

## Graph, Node, and Edge base classes
